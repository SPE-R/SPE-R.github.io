as described in [setup `R` and `RStudio` for SPE-R course with `renv`](https://github.com/SPE-R/SPE/blob/master/misc/SPE_setup.md).

> Note 1: Using RStudio is optional, any R code editor should work. 

> Note 2: If you do not want to use `renv` package you could follow the following instrucitons to install packages with `install.packages` command [Installing SPE-R requested packages](https://github.com/SPE-R/SPE/blob/gh-spe-material/prerequest.knit.md)
