## Timetable

[3-7 June 2024 course timetable](https://github.com/SPE-R/SPE/blob/master/adm/SPE-R-timetable.md) 

## Prerequisites

Before your arrival, you must install `R` and the list of packages requested for the course
as described in [setup `R` and `RStudio` for SPE-R course with `renv`](https://github.com/SPE-R/SPE/blob/master/misc/SPE_setup.md).

> Note 1: Using RStudio is recommanded. 

> Note 2: Install packages with `install.packages` instead of `renv` is also possible (see [Installing SPE-R packages](https://github.com/SPE-R/SPE/blob/gh-spe-material/prerequest.knit.md))

It is necessary to be familiar with basic R commands. If in doubt, it is strongly recommended to read the following chapters which are not covered in this course:

  - [Practice with basic `R`](https://spe-r.github.io/SPE/SPE-R-2024-practicals/practice-with-basic-r.html)
